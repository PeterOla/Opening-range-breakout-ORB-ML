 Abstract
 The validity of day trading as a long-term consistent and uncorrelated source of
 income for traders and investors is a matter of debate. In this paper, we endeav
ored to answer this question by conducting a thorough analysis of the profitability
 of Opening Range Breakout (ORB) strategies, with a particular focus on the 5
minute ORB. Using a large dataset that covered more than 7,000 US stocks traded
 from 2016 to 2023, the research aimed to assess how effective this strategy was in
 producing consistent and uncorrelated returns. A new aspect of our study was the
 focus on Stocks in Play, which are stocks that show higher than normal trading
 activity on a specific day, mostly because of fundamental news about the company.
 Our results showed a significant benefit in limiting day trading only to those Stocks
 in Play (even after considering transaction costs). A portfolio that consisted of
 the top 20 Stocks in Play achieved a total net performance of over 1,600%, with a
 Sharpe ratio of 2.81, and an annualized alpha of 36%. Passive exposure in the S&P
 500 would have achieved a total return of 198% during the same period. Further
more, this paper expanded the analysis to compare the return profile of the ORB
 strategy applied to different time frames, such as 15, 30, and 60 minutes. In the
 last part of the paper, we presented detailed stock-specific statistics for the 25 best
 and worst performers of an ORB strategy over all the time frames. To the best
 of our knowledge, this is the first public paper with such intraday granularity and
 comprehensive stock-level database.

1 Introduction
 Until the mid-2000s, the financial markets were largely the playground of Wall Street pro
fessionals. With the advent of advanced trading technologies, a flood of information on
 trading strategies, and the rise of affordable, even free, brokerage services, the landscape
 shifted dramatically. Now, the majority of Main Street are actively engaging with finan
cial markets. In 2023, 61% of adults in the United States invested in the stock market
 directly [1]. The 2020 pandemic served as a catalyst in this transformation. Lockdowns
 and market volatility sparked a surge in retail trading, especially in the stock market
 [17, 9, 14]. A landmark event was the 2021 GameStop (GME) short squeeze, an extraor
dinary David vs. Goliath tale where retail traders triumphed over Wall Street giants,
 leading to the dissolution of some professional trading firms [3]. This event symbolized
 the unleashed power of retail trading, a genie that is definitely not going back in the bottle.
 Most retail traders gravitate toward day trading or short-term swing trades. But there
 is a daunting challenge for retail traders who are competing with high-frequency trading
 (HFT) algorithms. They need access to proven strategies that can give them an edge and
 consistent advantage in the markets, often with technical analysis. Our previous research
 had been focused on informing retail traders [22] and developing, testing, and refining
 day trading strategies that are useful for retail traders without access to the lowest com
mission tiers or HFT capabilities [24, 23].
 Over the years, technical traders have developed and documented hundreds of trading
 systems. Among them, one of the most important and well-studied strategy that has
 gained considerable attention is the n-minute ORB, with popular variants including 5
minute, 15-minute, 30-minute and 60-minute time frames. As shown conceptually in
 Figure 1, the ORB strategy typically focuses on identifying the highest and lowest prices
 during the first n-minutes of trading, and then buying or selling when the stock breaks
 out of this range only in the direction of the opening range. For instance, a positive open
 suggests a long position upon breaking the high, while a negative open indicates a short
 position upon breaking the low.

 for going long (as shown on the left-hand side) and for going short (as shown on the right-hand side).
 Toby Crabel is often credited with first introducing the ORB (back in 1990)[11]. In his
 book, Day Trading with Short Term Price Patterns and Opening Range Breakout, which
 was one of the earliest and most detailed descriptions of how to trade short-term price
 patterns across markets, he extensively analyzed the profitability of volatility breakout
 strategies across various futures markets. In his model, the range was calibrated combin
ing previous days’ volatility with current opening prices. The strategy did not use any
 intraday data information to define the opening range. In the book, Crabel detailed his
 core trading philosophy, that any robust trading strategy should capture explainable mar
ket participant behavior. Traders must understand the mass psychology of the traders
 behind the price action. Essentially, traders are social psychologists behind a computer
 program [12].
 Over the years, the ORB strategy has been studied and documented significantly both
 by market participants [23, 4, 2, 10, 15] and academia [8, 18, 13, 21, 19, 16]. In 1995,
 Raschke and Connors [10] introduced the Momentum Pinball strategy, a model that im
proves the ORB strategy by combining a 60-minute ORB with a 3-day Relative Strength
 Index (RSI) of a 1-day rate of change. Their study was tested on different futures mar
kets, but the authors suggested that the same methodology could have been applied to
 common equity markets.
 4
In his seminal work in 1992, Brock et al. [8] demonstrated the effectiveness of simple
 technical trading rules, specifically the moving average and ORBs, applied on almost
 100 years of Dow Jones Index data. His findings were pivotal in challenging the random
 walk hypothesis, a financial theory stating that stock market prices evolve according to
 a random walk and thus cannot be predicted, and emphasized the potential of techni
cal analysis strategies in market prediction. In 2009, Schulmeister [18] focused on the
 frequency of data in technical trading. By analyzing S&P 500 data from 1960 to 2000,
 and the futures market from 1983 to 2000, Schulmeister demonstrated that models using
 30-minute interval data were more profitable than those relying on daily data, suggesting
 a shift toward higher frequency trading in technical analysis.
 In 2012, Holmberg et al. [13] studied the profitability of volatility ORBs on US crude
 oil futures prices from 1983 until 2011. Their results showed that a volatility ORB was
 significantly profitable, but the profitability was mostly generated in the last decade
 (2000-2011). In 2018, Tsai et al. [19] further expanded the research on ORB strategies
 by assessing their performance across multiple indices (Dow Jones Industrial Average,
 S&P 500, and Nasdaq) and for different opening range time frames. The results showed
 that the most significant profits occur when the opening range length is within 5 minutes
 from the open. Their research did not consider any profit target or stop loss mechanisms.
 In 2017, Lundstr¨om [16] examined ORB returns in different volatility states based on
 long-term crude oil data and S&P 500 futures contracts, and he found that the prof
itability of ORB grows with the volatility of the underlyng asset.
 To improve the system and generate larger returns compared to the overall market, Wu et
 al. in 2020 introduced an evolutionary approach by utilizing a genetic algorithm in their
 ORB-based model [21]. Their method optimized thresholds and protective closing strate
gies, significantly enhancing profitability and reducing risks. This study was conducted
 on Taiwan Index Futures between 2007 and 2018 and showed that the introduction of
 a profit target is detrimental for overall profitability. The study showed enhanced prof
itability once a stop loss mechanism was introduced.
 5
Recently, we provided significant evidence of profitability for a 5-minute ORB applied on
 QQQandTQQQETFs[23]. We introduced the use of stop losses and large profit targets
 and found that a 5-minute ORB on TQQQ would have earned an outstanding return of
 1,484% between 2016 and 2023, while a passive investment in the QQQ ETF would have
 earned only 169%.
 In this paper, our goal was to apply the 5-minute ORB framework developed in our pre
vious work [23], but instead of utilizing only QQQ or TQQQ, we expanded the study to
 all US stocks traded between 2016 and 2023, and assessed if trading volume and other
 parameters have any statistically meaningful forecasting power on day trading profitabil
ity.
 2 Strategy Definition
 As previously referenced, a 5-minute ORB strategy is a trading strategy that focuses
 on catching a breakout from the initial range in the first 5 minutes of the trading day
 [23, 4, 5]. In this current work, we introduced a crucial parameter to this ORB strategy.
 If the first 5-minute candlestick was bearish (meaning it closed below its opening price),
 our system would only take a short position. We would not go for a long position even
 if the price broke above the 5-minute opening range candlestick. Similarly, if the first
 5-minute candlestick was bullish (meaning it closed above the opening price), we would
 stick to taking only a long position. We would avoid taking a short position, even if the
 price dropped below the 5-minute opening range candlestick [23].
 The opening range is often thought to provide some useful insight about the institutional
 supply and demand imbalance that will prevail throughout the day. Day traders typically
 employ tight stop losses to maximize exposure to intraday trends, letting profits run as
 long as the trend persists. Setting the right stop loss is crucial and can really make or
 break a trading strategy. If you set your stop loss too close to your entry point, you might
 get stopped out too soon or too often. This can lead to missing out on big moves, rack
6
ing up small losses, and paying higher commissions and fees. On the other hand, a stop
 loss that is too wide could lead to bigger losses and unsatisfactory levels of reward to risk.
 Traders have different ways of setting stop losses. Some use technical tools like mov
ing averages, VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) or other mathematical indicators
 [24]. Others prefer to set them based on judgment calls, using key levels like the low or
 high of the day. A common approach [24, 4] is to set the stop loss at a percentage of the
 14-day average true range (ATR)1.
 For example, as shown in Figure 2, the daily ATR of a company called BLDR on January
 22, 2024 was $5. The following day the stock dipped in the first 5 minutes, prompting
 a sell stop order at the opening range’s low ($174.44). Half an hour later, the stock
 breached this level, executing the order. The stop loss was set at 10% of the daily ATR
 (10% x $5 = $0.50) from the entry point. We have previously looked into how using a
 stop loss based on ATR affects the ORB strategy and found a link between the expected
 value of the return and the stop loss [23].
 To analyze the result, Profit & Loss (PnL) is often quantified in units of risk (R) rather
 than in dollar value. Figure 2 shows an example of howR unit is utilized in trade manage
ment and analysis. In this case, a short trade was triggered, and the R was the potential
 maximum loss per share, which was $0.50. The profit target was set at the end of the
 day (EoD). The trade’s per share movement was $6.81 ($174.44- $167.63), translating
 to a PnL of 13.62 times the R, or 13.62R ($6.81/0.50).
 The US stocks analyzed in this study encompassed all equities listed on US exchanges
 (both NYSE and Nasdaq) from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2023 (we called them
 the universe. This universe comprised approximately 7,000 stocks and was free from
 1The ATR is a technical analysis indicator used to measure market volatility. It was introduced by
 J. Welles Wilder Jr. in his 1978 book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems [20]. The ATR
 calculates the average range between the highest and lowest prices over a given number of past trading
 sessions, typically 14 days. This range includes the comparison of the current high to the previous
 close, the current low to the previous close, and the current high to the current low. The ATR does not
 indicate price direction but rather the degree of price volatility. High ATR values indicate high volatility,
 suggesting wider price ranges and potentially greater risk or opportunity for traders. Conversely, low
 ATR values suggest low market volatility, indicating tighter price ranges.

 the database was not influenced by any retrospective price adjustments. All backtests
 and statistical analyses were performed using MATLAB R2023a.

2.1 Base Strategy
 We implemented some rules for choosing the stocks we studied. Not all stocks in the US
 markets are suitable for day trading due to varying levels of liquidity or trading volume.
 Our best approach was to exclude penny stocks and other low-liquidity stocks. To avoid
 making decisions based on hindsight, we used set criteria to narrow down our list of stocks
 on any given day. The stocks we considered had to meet the following requirements:
 1. The opening price had to be above $5.
 2. The average trading volume over the previous 14 days had to be at least 1,000,000
 shares per day.
 3. The ATR over the previous 14 days had to be more than $0.50.
 These criteria ensured that the stocks we analyzed had sufficient liquidity and volatility
 as well as favorable conditions for day trading [4, 2].
 Entry Conditions
 With each eligible stock, we placed a stop order (not to be confused with a stop loss
 order) at a level equal to the high/low of the 5-minute range, in the direction of the
 opening range. For example, if a stock had a bullish move within the first 5 minutes of
 trading (from 9:30 am until 9:35 am ET), we placed a stop order at the highest value of
 the 5-minute opening range (known as the 5-minute high). Conversely, if a stock had a
 bearish move within the first 5 minutes of trading, we placed a stop order at the lowest
 value of the 5-minute opening range (known as the 5-minute low). In the case of a doji
 (open = close) forming in the first 5 minutes, no order was placed.
 Stop Loss and Profit Target
 In case the order was triggered, we placed a stop loss order at a 10% ATR distance from
 the executed entry price. If the stop loss was not reached intraday, we closed the position
 at the end of the trading session (i.e., 4:00 pm ET).
 9
Position Sizing
 Each stock was traded such that in case of the stop loss being hit, the resulting loss
 incurred on the capital deployed for that position would be 1%. We also set a maximum
 leverage constraint at 4x, in accordance with the majority of US FINRA-regulated bro
kers3.
 The resulting long-short portfolio to be traded on any given day was thus composed of
 all the stocks that satisfied the filters (as defined above) and whose opening range was
 either positive or negative.
 The backtest was conducted from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2023. We assumed a
 starting capital of $25,000 and incorporated a commission cost of $0.0035 per share (this
 f
 igure represented the entry-level commission fee charged by Interactive Brokers Pro
Tiered as of December 31, 2023).
 Figure 3 displays the equity curve for the portfolio generated by the diversified 5-minute
 ORB strategy across all US stocks. With an initial investment of $25,000, the portfolio
 appreciated by 30%, resulting in a net profit of only $7,500 after accounting for commis
sion fees. In contrast, during the same period, a passive long position in the S&P 500
 would have seen an increase of nearly 200%, equating to a profit of about $50,000.
 As detailed in Table 1, the active 5-minute ORB strategy underperformed, yielding a
 modest annual return of only 3.2% and experiencing an annual volatility of approxi
mately 6.6%. This resulted in a Sharpe Ratio of 0.48, which was significantly lower than
 the 0.78 Sharpe ratio for the S&P 500.
 Despite this overall underperformance when compared to the benchmark, the 5-minute
 ORB strategy showed some encouraging results. Specifically, its maximum drawdown
 (MDD) was only 13%, compared to the S&P 500’s MDD of 34% within the same time
 frame. Moreover, in terms of the worst single day returns, the 5-minute ORB strategy’s

 The effect of leverage on position sizing was well-documented and studied in our previous paper [23].

 described in Section 2.1 (black line). The analysis covers the period from January 1, 2016 to December
 31, 2023, with an initial net asset value of $25,000 and a commission rate of $0.0035 per share.

pared to the S&P 500’s maximum loss (on March 16, 2020, during the COVID pandemic)
 of-10.9%.
 Since the validity of day trading as a long-term consistent and uncorrelated source of
 income for traders and investors is a matter of debate, we decided to run a simple linear
 regression analysis to see if the 5-minute ORB returns were correlated with S&P 500
 returns and to see if there was any abnormal return in excess of what can be extracted
 by a passive market exposure. Further insights were also gained from this simple linear
 regression analysis, where the daily returns of the 5-minute ORB strategy were regressed
 against the daily returns of the S&P 500. This method, commonly employed by academia

 regression equation utilized was4:

 The beta coefficient of the ORB strategy, being close to 0, indicated a negligible correla
tion with the S&P 500. Additionally, an alpha of 3.26% per annum represented the profit
 generated by the ORB strategy that was not attributable to simple market exposure.
 What factors, therefore, contributed to the basic 5-minute ORB strategy’s lackluster per
formance? To understand the underlying causes, we must revisit the core concept of the
 ORB strategy. This strategy aims to identify assets that exhibit an abnormal imbalance
 between demand and supply in the first few minutes of the trading session. The hypothe
sis is that this imbalance will persist throughout the session, creating exploitable intraday
 trends. While the direction of the demand-supply imbalance can be inferred from the
 opening range, its abnormality can be assessed by comparing its current opening range
 volume to its recent average.
 In the following section, we introduce a straightforward metric to measure the abnormal
ity of the opening range volume. We will also examine whether this metric effectively
 predicts the subsequent realized PnL of the ORB strategy.
 4For the purposes of simplicity, the risk-free rate was not included in the regression analysis. Nev
ertheless, throughout the backtesting period, the risk-free rate in the US was negligible and, therefore,
 should not have a significant impact on the results.

3 Not All Opening Range Are Created Equally
 You are only as good as the stocks that you trade– Mike Bellafiore[6]
 A prevalent strategy among experienced day traders is to focus their intraday trading
 activities on Stocks in Play [6, 7]. A stock is considered in play when it shows unusual
 trading activity throughout the day, which often results in an expansion of its daily price
 range and a distinct trend in its intraday price movements. A stock is typically expected
 to be in play in response to a major fundamental catalyst that prompts institutional
 investors to re-evaluate their financial positions in it. Common catalysts include:
 • Earnings reports
 • Earnings warnings or pre-announcements
 • Earnings surprises
 • FDA approvals or disapprovals
 • Mergers/acquisitions
 • Alliances, partnerships, or major product releases
 • Major contract wins/losses
 • Restructuring, layoffs, or management changes
 • Stock splits, buybacks, or debt offerings
 • Break of key technical levels.
 While a fundamental catalyst is often necessary to trigger abnormal trading activity in a
 stock, it is not always sufficient to classify it as a Stock in Play. If the market has already
 priced in the catalyst, institutional investors may not react significantly, resulting in
 minimal trading activity. An effective method for traders to determine if a catalyst is
 indeed causing unusually high trading activity is through the use of Relative Volume. This
 metric is a statistical comparison of the day’s trading volume against the average volume
 from previous days. For real-time analysis, traders can calculate the Relative Volume

Relative Volume of over 30x (or more than 3,000%), the average profitability per trade
 soared to 0.38R.
 While focusing exclusively on stocks with a 30x trading activity may seem attractive in
 terms of PnL per trade, this approach might limit the total number of trades available per
 year, potentially impacting the ability to meet a predefined annual target. There is only
 a limited number of Stocks in Play every week that can reach such high trading volume.
 In the upcoming section, we will explain how we leveraged these insights to enhance the
 efficiency of trading the 5-minute ORB strategy in the US market.
 4 Opening Range Breakout on Stocks in Play
 To enhance the effectiveness of the Base Strategy, we proposed an additional constraint:
 the strategy should not trade stocks that exhibit below-average trading activity during
 the opening range (9:30 am to 9:35 am ET). This means we would exclusively focus
 on those stocks whose Relative Volume was at least 100%. Furthermore, to ensure we
 were trading the most in play stocks of the day, our strategy would only take positions
 in the top 20 stocks experiencing the highest Relative Volume. The revised strategy
 incorporated the following filters:
 1. The opening price had to be above $5.
 2. The average trading volume over the previous 14 days had to be at least 1,000,000
 shares per day.
 3. The ATR over the previous 14 days had to be more than $0.50.
 4. The Relative Volume had to be at least 100%.
 5. Trade the stocks with the top 20 Relative Volume.
 As for the base strategy, the direction of each trade (long or short) was determined by
 the initial movement of the opening range. A positive opening range prompted a stop
 buy order, whereas a negative one led to a stop sell order. For every position we opened,

 we set a stop loss at 10% of the ATR. If a position was not stopped during the day, it
 was unwound at the end of the trading day.
 Consistent with the Base Strategy, each stock was traded in such a way that should the
 stop loss be triggered, the loss on the capital allocated to that position would not exceed
 1%. Additionally, we imposed a maximum leverage constraint of 4x, in line with the reg
ulations of most US FINRA-regulated brokers. The starting assets under management
 (AUM) and the commission per share remained the same as in the base case.
 Figure 5 displays in blue the equity trajectory for this new version of the 5-minute ORB
 strategy. The improvement compared to the base strategy is substantial, with a remark

 able outperformance against the passive buy-and-hold approach. From January 1, 2016
 to December 31, 2023, an initial investment of $25,000 in this strategy would have grown
 to approximately $435,000, equating to an extraordinary total net return of 1,637%. In
 contrast, a passive investment in the S&P 500 during the same period would have seen
 growth from $25,000 to about $75,000, which is roughly a 200% increase.
 Table 2 presents the performance statistics for this newly refined 5-minute ORB strategy,
 highlighting significant improvements over the Base Strategy. The annual rate of return
 soared from 3.2% in the ORB Base to an impressive 41.6%. Equally noteworthy was the
 increase in the Sharpe Ratio, which rose more than 5-fold, from 0.48 to an extraordinary
 2.81.
 While the MDD showed a modest improvement, the worst day loss slightly deteriorated,
 likely due to the more concentrated nature of the portfolio (in fact, in the ORB + Rel
 Vol portfolio we traded only the top 20 stocks). The potential for a greater worst day
 loss in a more concentrated portfolio arises from the increased exposure to specific stock
 movements, which can lead to more pronounced losses on days when those stocks perform
 poorly. In line with the previous analysis, we conducted a regression of the strategy’s daily
 returns against those of the S&P 500, with remarkable findings. The beta coefficient re
mained close to zero, indicating minimal dependency on overall market movements. Most
 strikingly, the alpha surged to an impressive 36% per annum.
 Considering that these returns were net of commission and the strategy’s parameters

 we are confident that these results could maintain their robustness and significance in
 future applications.
 5 Opening Range Breakout on Other-Time Frames
 The ORB strategy can be applied across various time frames during the first trading
 hour from the open (9:30am to around 10:30am ET), where market volatility and liq
uidity are at their peak. Although the 5-minute frame is standard, we thought it would

 be worthwhile to also explore other popular time frames such as 15, 30, or 60 minutes.
 For this purpose, we investigated our ORB strategy across various time frames, limiting
 our study to Stocks in Play with at least 100% Relative Volume in their respective first
 n-minute time frame.
 For example, the Relative Volume for a 15-minute ORB is measured in the first 15 min
utes, and for a 30-minute ORB, it is compared with the first 30-minute average over the
 previous 14 days. The results are presented in Figure 6 and Table 3, comparing them
 to a simple S&P 500 buy-and-hold portfolio. As can be seen, the 5-minute ORB sig
nificantly outperformed the other time frames as well as a passive exposure in the S&P
 500. The reason for the 5-minute ORB’s superior performance is unclear and warrants
 further investigation. A plausible explanation might be that the shorter the time-frame
 that define the opening range, the greater the portion of the move captured by the ORB
 on trend days.

as a sustainable income source.
 The remarkable performance of the 5-minute ORB strategy, in particular, stands out,
 demonstrating a notable advantage over both longer time frames within the ORB strat
egy and a passive buy-and-hold approach. This strategy achieved a net performance of
 over 1,600%, with a Sharpe ratio of 2.81, and an annualized alpha of 36%, significantly
 outperforming the passive S&P 500 return of 198% over the same period. Such results
 not only provide empirical support for the ORB strategy’s efficacy but also emphasize
 the critical role of selecting stocks with substantial trading activity, driven by underlying
 fundamental news, to capitalize on intraday volatility and liquidity.
 Furthermore, our exploration into varying time frames for the ORB strategy enriches the
 discourse on day trading methodologies, offering traders nuanced perspectives on optimiz
ing their strategies to enhance profitability and manage risk. The superior performance
 of the 5-minute ORB suggests a unique dynamic at play in the earliest phases of the
 trading day, highlighting an area ripe for further exploration.
 This paper contributes to the body of financial literature by providing a detailed, stock
specific analysis of ORB performance across different time frames, a first of its kind with
 such intraday granularity. Our rigorous statistical analysis, grounded in economic ratio
nale rather than retrospective optimization, suggests that the findings presented herein
 could maintain their robustness and significance in future applications.
 As the landscape of retail trading continues to evolve, our study reaffirms the importance
 of informed strategy selection, emphasizing the potential of technical analysis and specif
ically the ORB strategy, to level the playing field for individual traders against more
 sophisticated market participants. However, while the ORB strategy presents a promis
ing avenue for day traders, it is crucial to approach it with thorough research, disciplined
 risk management, and a clear understanding of market dynamics.
 In future research, further investigation into the reasons behind the 5-minute ORB’s
 exceptional performance, as well as the exploration of additional variables that may
 22
influence the strategy’s success, will be invaluable. This could include the impact of
 market conditions, the role of news and earnings announcements, and the integration of
 other technical indicators to refine entry and exit points. Through ongoing analysis and
 adaptation, traders can continue to hone their strategies to navigate the complexities of
 the financial markets effectively.
