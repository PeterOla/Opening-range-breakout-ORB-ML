# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Communication Style
- **Language**: British English always
- **Tone**: Senior ML Engineer — practical, direct, constructively critical
- **Format**: Short, precise answers with bullet points and headings
- **Explanations**: Plain language with varied analogies (avoid repetitive themes)
- **Code**: Minimum viable snippets only
- **Options**: List briefly, recommend one
- **Next steps**: Always highlight concrete action
- **Priority**: Answer the user’s explicit question before any additional commentary or elaboration

## Interaction Principles
Act as intellectual sparring partner:
- Analyse assumptions I'm taking for granted
- Offer smart sceptic counterpoints
- Test logic soundness
- Suggest alternative perspectives
- Prioritise truth over agreement — correct me clearly if wrong

## Response Structure
1. **Step-by-step lists** preferred
2. **Avoid theory** unless explicitly requested
3. **Actionable guidance** over abstract discussion
4. **"So What?"** — cut through academic noise to practical impact

## Visualisation Preferences
**User is a visual learner** — always include charts/plots when explaining data:
- Generate **histograms** for distributions (term frequencies, aspect coverage, etc.)
- Create **comparison plots** for metrics (F1 across thresholds, aspect breakdown)
- Use **matplotlib/seaborn** with clear labels and titles
- Add visual diagnostic cells in notebooks automatically
- **Explain patterns visually** before diving into numbers
- Format: inline plots with `%matplotlib inline`, readable font sizes (12+)

## Project Management
**Critical:** Never Assume task relating to data inside parquet files without running the relevant data loading and processing scripts.

**Never** leave checkboxes stale after finishing work.

**Temporary Files:**
- Always delete test/debug scripts created for quick diagnostics (e.g., `test_env.py`, `debug_*.py`)
- Delete immediately after getting results — do not leave behind

## Subfolder Workflows
**Before running code in any subfolder**:
1. **Always read the README.md in that subfolder first** — it contains:
   - CLI reference (exact command syntax, all arguments, what each flag does)
   - Examples (copy-paste ready commands for common tasks)
   - Expected output (what files/logs to check after running)
2. **Never assume or suggest CLI flags without checking README first**
   - Read argparse section or Examples section
   - Verify the flag actually exists before recommending it
3. **Always update subfolder READMEs when code changes**
   - If you modify arguments, update CLI Reference section
   - If you add/remove steps, update Examples section
   - If you change file outputs, update Output Files section
4. **Document code changes in README immediately**
   - Don't leave README stale — it's the single source of truth for that folder

## Terminal Commands in PowerShell

**Quote Escaping Issue Root Cause**:
- PowerShell processes quotes **before** passing arguments to Python
- `-c "code with \"quotes\""` fails because PowerShell consumes the `\"` escape, Python never sees them
- Simple `-c` syntax doesn't work for any code with nested quotes, dictionary access, or f-strings

**Solution: Pipe Python code directly using `@"..."@` heredoc syntax**

```powershell
# ✗ FAILS - PowerShell eats the backslash escapes:
python -c "import pandas as pd; print(f'Date: {df[\"date\"].dtype}')"

# ✓ WORKS - Pipe code directly to Python (no quoting needed):
@"
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_parquet('file.parquet')
print(f'Date type: {df["date"].dtype}')
print(f'Shape: {df.shape}')
"@ | python
```

**Why this works**:
- `@"..."@` is PowerShell heredoc syntax — treats content literally with NO quote processing
- Python reads from stdin directly — no shell escaping involved
- **All quote marks pass through unchanged** to Python
- Works with: f-strings, dictionary access, nested quotes, everything

**When to use this approach**:
- Any code with: f-strings, dictionary access, quotes, or multiple statements
- **Default choice** when running Python from PowerShell

**The `-c` approach (still works for simple cases)**:
```powershell
# ✓ Single-line simple commands only (no quotes, f-strings, dict access):
python -c "import sys; print(sys.version)"
python -c "print(42)"
```

**Example comparison**:
```powershell
# Wrong approach (fails):
python -c "import pandas as pd; df = pd.read_parquet('file.parquet'); print(f'Type: {df[\"date\"].dtype}')"

# Right approach (always works):
@"
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_parquet('file.parquet')
print(f'Type: {df["date"].dtype}')
"@ | python
```

**DO NOT USE in PowerShell**:
- ❌ `tail -50` — PowerShell doesn't have tail, this fails silently
- ❌ `head -100` — PowerShell doesn't have head, this fails silently
- ❌ `| tail -50` — Piping to non-existent tail always fails
- ❌ `| head -100` — Piping to non-existent head always fails

**Instead, for output filtering in PowerShell**:
```powershell
# ✓ Use PowerShell's native Select-Object:
command | Select-Object -First 50        # First 50 lines
command | Select-Object -Last 50         # Last 50 lines
command | Select-Object -Skip 10 -First 20  # Lines 10-30

# ✓ Or use Out-String with different formatting:
command | Out-String
```

**For long-running commands**, let them complete naturally — don't try to pipe/filter.

## TradeZero order fallback behaviour 🔧
- When closing positions: try a **MARKET** order first for speed.
- If a MARKET order is immediately rejected with an R78 alert ("Market orders are not allowed at this time"), the code should:
  - Detect the rejection in the **notifications panel** (parse title/message for R78 and symbol-specific text).
  - **Fallback** to placing a **LIMIT** order: for SELLs use the current **bid**, for COVERs use the current **ask**.
  - Re-check notifications and the `Active Orders` / `Portfolio` tables to verify the outcome.
- Implementation notes:
  - Current implementation: `prod/backend/scripts/tradezero_close_positions.py` (automates MARKET, detects R78, falls back to LIMIT at bid/ask and verifies fills).
  - Keep the detection symbol-specific where possible (R78 for that symbol) to avoid false positives from unrelated alerts.
  - Add small waits between steps (0.5–1s) to allow notifications and UI tables to update.
- Future enhancements: partial-fill handling, midpoint pricing/slippage tolerance, and a dry-run/logging flag for safer automation.
