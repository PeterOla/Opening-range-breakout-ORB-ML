## Overview

A hybrid approach combining **Opening Range Breakout (ORB)** signals with **Fibonacci retracement pullbacks** for improved entry prices and risk-to-reward ratios. Works on equities and futures; optimised for 5-minute charts during the first 1–2 hours post-open.

**Core principle**: Don't chase the initial breakout; wait for price to retrace to a Fibonacci level (50% or 61.8%) with oscillator confirmation (MACD/RSI) before entering.

## Strategy Rules

### Step 1: Identify Opening Range (First 15–30 Minutes)

- Track the **opening range high and low** on the 5-minute chart
- Note the direction of the OR candle close (bullish = long bias, bearish = short bias)
- Wait for a **breakout** of that high or low to confirm momentum

### Step 2: Wait for Pullback (Fibonacci Entry)

After the initial breakout signal:
- Do **NOT** chase immediately
- Draw **Fibonacci retracement** levels from the session low → high (long setups) or high → low (short setups)
- **Entry target zones**: 50% or 61.8% Fibonacci retracement
- This improves entry price vs entering at the breakout itself

### Step 3: Confirm with Oscillator (MACD or RSI)

Add a third layer of confirmation at your intended entry:
- **MACD**: Look for bullish divergence or price starting to curl back up from midline
- **RSI**: Acceptable alternatives; any oscillator you're comfortable with
- **Goal**: Avoid false breakouts by requiring confluence of three signals (breakout + Fib level + oscillator)

### Step 4: Define Stop & Target

**Stop Loss**:
- Just below the **78.6% Fibonacci level**, OR
- Just below the **recent swing low**
- Tight stops = small losses

**Profit Target**:
- New **session high/low** (or next resistance/support)
- Aim for 2:1+ risk-to-reward ratio

## Example Trade Setup

```
LONG SETUP:
1. ORB breakout above opening range high (bullish signal)
   ├─ Initial breakout move up (don't chase here)
   
2. Price pulls back to 61.8% Fibonacci level
   ├─ Fibonacci drawn from session low → breakout high
   
3. MACD at pullback shows bullish divergence OR curling up
   ├─ This is your entry trigger
   
4. Entry: At 61.8% Fib with MACD confirmation
   ├─ Stop: Below 78.6% Fib or recent swing low (tight)
   ├─ Target: Session high or next resistance (2x risk)
```

## Advantages

| Benefit | Why It Works |
|---------|-------------|
| **Tight stops** | Entry on pullback = lower stop placement → small losses |
| **Excellent R:R** | Can easily achieve 2:1 or 3:1 reward-to-risk |
| **Filters noise** | Three-layer confirmation (breakout + Fib + oscillator) eliminates false signals |
| **Proven track record** | 3 years of consistent 10–15K/month returns |
| **Mechanical** | Clear, repeatable rules (no ambiguity) |

---

## Challenges

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Patience required** | You'll watch big moves happen without you (waiting for pullback) |
| **Missed trades** | Sometimes pullback never comes; you miss the trade entirely |
| **Screen time** | Requires focus for first 1–2 hours post-open (can't be away from desk) |
| **Market regime dependent** | Works best in trending markets; choppy markets = fewer clean pullbacks |

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Set up 5-minute chart for your target stock/future
- [ ] Mark opening range high/low (9:30–9:45 ET or equivalent)
- [ ] Add Fibonacci retracement tool to chart
- [ ] Set up MACD or RSI oscillator indicator
- [ ] Define pre-market risk management (stop loss %, max trades/day)
- [ ] Practice identifying setups on paper/simulator
- [ ] Trade small size initially (1–2 shares/contracts)
- [ ] Track win rate and R:R on each trade

## Key Insight

> "It's a simple concept, but the discipline to wait for all three pieces to align is the real key."

**The edge is NOT in the tools** (Fibonacci, MACD are common). **The edge is in patience and discipline** — most traders enter at the breakout (immediate gratification), but you enter 20–30 minutes later at a better price with lower risk. Over hundreds of trades, this compounds into 10–15K/month.

---

## Notes

- Works on **equities and futures**
- Optimised for **first 1–2 hours after market open**
- Adapts to **any timeframe** (5-min, 15-min, 30-min), but tested on 5-min
- Requires **active monitoring** (not a swing trade strategy)
- Best suited for **trending market conditions** (avoid choppy/range-bound days)

## Trade Safe

This strategy prioritises **risk management and confluence** over chasing big moves.
